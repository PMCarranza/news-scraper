# **NEWS SCRAPER**
News Scraper retrieves the lates headlines from LaHora.gt

## **Description**
News Scraper is a web app that lets users view and leave comments on the latest news retrieved for La Hora.gt (the users have the opportunity to dust off their spanish!). This app is driven by the combined horsepower of Mongoose and Cheerio.

## **Installation**
I have used npm init and npm start to get going.
I have also installed, axios, express, cheerio, mongoose as dependancies using the npm install command.
This is what you are going to need if you would like to clone the repository.

## **Contributors**
At this point in time I am the only one contributing to this app, if you would like to provide feedback or build upon it please let me know.

## **Authors and acknowledgment**
This app was created by Mari√±o Carranza (me), using a code from previous exercises and the always welcome assistance and guidance from the instructoral staff, especially Catherine Pham.

## **Project status
I do not have any plans at the moment to develop this app further, I can think of other news related web sites that could be scraped but that just modifies the app.

## **Support**
I will do my best to answer the questions you may have about this app.
